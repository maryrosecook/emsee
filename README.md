A webapp for visualizing the action of a
[Metropolis-Hastings sampler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_hastings). This is meant
as a teaching tool to get an intuition for how these algorithms work.
Currently capable of plotting functions in two dimensions and illustrating the action of a
sampler attempting to minmize them. Extending this to three dimensions is in progress.
