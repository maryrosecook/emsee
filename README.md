A webapp for visualizing the action of a
[Metropolis-Hastings sampler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_hastings). This is meant
as a teaching tool to get an intuition for how these algorithms work. Will plot and animate functions
in one and two dimensions. Depends on Flask, NumPy, SciPy, and emcee.
